# DMD_Holography
This project aims to study the properties of a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) in the Fourier plane. Working in the Fourier plane can allow for the modulation of the phase and amplitude of a beam in the system, which can then be used to create detailed potentials that could be applied to the atoms in the cold atoms lattice experiment. The work done on this project so far has closely followed the thesis titled "Light Modulation with a Digital Micromirror Device" by Isabelle Racicot. Reading that thesis, as well as the thesis titled "Dynamic Holography and Beamshaping using Digital Micromirror Devices" by Philip P. J. Zupancic, will be extermely helpful in the understanding of this topic. Tristan Gautie's report, "Beamshaping :The Digital Micromirror Device in a Cold Atoms experiment", is also helpful in learning how to use the DMD, create images that can be uploaded to the DMD, and to create and upload the firmware that contains images to the DMD, since he uses the same DMD that I am using for this project, except Tristan operated it in the image plane. 

As of August 21st, 2019, I have assembled the optical setup used for opertating the DMD in the Fourier plane, taken calibration images for the phase and amplitude mapping of the system, as well as created a pipeline that crops the calibration images, fits a 2D sine function multiplied by a 2D gaussian to the cropped images, generates the phase and amplitude maps of the system and finally generates a grating use for holographic beam shaping. The final hologram grating that I generated did not yield the expected results, which could be due to the phase instability of the optical setup, and/or potentially the way I coded the amplitude modulation portion of the hologram generation. This will be further discussed in the Future Work section at the end of this README.

There are two main python scripts used for this process, gratingGenerator.py and hologramGenerator.py.

The script gratingGenerator.py does exactly what it sounds like it does, it creates a series of calibration gratings, each containing a stationary "patch" near the center of the image, and a second patch that changes position in each image. The size of the patches can be altered here, as well as the location of the center patch. The angle and period of the underlying grating can also be changed. However, it should be noted that any changes made here to the size and location of patches must also be made to the hologramGenerator.py script, as I have not combined the two yet. The calibration images are saved as 1-bit .bmp files so that they can be compiled into a 24-bit image using the LightCrafter4500 GUI, which is the GUI used to control the DMD. 

The script hologramGenerator.py is where the bulk of the code exists. This is where the calibration images, which are images of the interference patterns taken when projecting each of the different calibration gratings on the DMD, are cropped and fitted in order to obtain the phase and amplitude of the interference pattern. The program then uses these parameters to generate a phase and amplitude map of the system and then uses those maps to generate a holographic grating. There are a few parameters in this program that need to be tweaked depending on the parameters of the experiment. The first set of parameters that should be modified are..
